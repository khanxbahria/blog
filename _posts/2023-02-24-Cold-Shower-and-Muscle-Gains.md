I've been having cold showers right after my morning workout sessions for a past few days. Since then, I've started to feel more pain in sore muscles specifically the chest and biceps. Muscle recovery seems to be taking longer than usual.

The weather is cold here. The main reason I decided to have cold showers was to discipline myself and keep myself awake for the rest of the day. It felt like conditioning myself to remain calm in intense conditions. It worked well.

However it's a different situation now. I am focusing on hypertrophy based workout to gain more muscle mass also I prefer taking a shower right after it than later. Knowing the benefits of cold shower, it seemed like a good idea. But I was wrong. Here is a research statement:
> Cold water immersion attenuates anabolic signaling and skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy, but not strength gain (Fyfe, et. al., 2019).

This corresponds to Cold Water Immersion which is different than Cold Shower. Althought no research seems to be carried regarding the effects of cold shower on muscle recovery, however I believe the effects would be similar which explains my unusually long lasting muscle pain.

So cold showers were a bad idea for me. I should be careful next time and do research before adding anything into my routine. If there's any obstacle that hinders my growth and performance, it should be removed. I will be switching back to mild warm showers.
