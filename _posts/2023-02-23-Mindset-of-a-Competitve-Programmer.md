## Introduction
Competitive Programming is one of the many fields of Computer Science that attracts little attention compared to other mainstream disciplines. It is a mind sport where contestants write code to solve challenging mathematical and logical problems in a short period of time. A multi-discplinary field that involves programming, mathematics and problem-solving seemed like a perfect fit for me, or so I thought.

Few years back in high school, as an absoulte beginner I tried joining codeforces to participate in my first competition and failed miserably, solving 0 questions. I gave up. 
Until this year, I decided to give it another shot... but this time it was a 1 week long competitive programming bootcamp offered by [inzva](https://inzva.com/), a community coding club in Turkey.

Although I am still a beginner, I am writing this to share my observations of my fellows whom I met at the bootcamp and those who were more experienced at it. These people always struck me as smart geniuses who are able to solve challenging problems by writing code.

## Skills Required
The following is a list of skills that you may find in top competitive programmers. If you have these skills, competitive programming could easily become one of your interests.

### Avid Problem Solvers
They are avid problem solvers! They can visualize the problems, from numbers to complicated algorithms, they are able to quickly visualize it all. Moreover, finding solutions to those problems is not simple as a google search; most often the problem statements are very implicit in terms of what algorithm should be used. This makes problem-solving a valuable skill on its own. They are curious solvers who could stay up all nights to discuss or to figure out the answers.

### Mathematics
As a field that that has little to do with programming and more related to mathematics, it is often misunderstood by us programmers. Competitive programming requires an extensive knowledge of mathematical topics such as Number Theory, Combinatorics, etc. Having a strong foundation in mathematics is an essential skill. Many top competitive coders pursue math degree!

### DSA
Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) is perhaps the only fundamental topic from Computer Science that you might need to learn for it. A problem could possibly be solved in many ways but an optimized solution is generally required, which involves using the right data structures and algorithms.

### Competitive
Short time constraints and a good competition is cherry on top. This element makes it more interesting. The programmers need to be quick and proficient in the above mentioned skills to solve in a really limited time constraint. They may even invest their time customizing their code editor for fast typing (which may or may not be worth it).

### Not neccessarily good software engineers
It's a myth that competitive programmers are bad software engineers. One may pick up bad habits from competitive programming but it is not entirely true. However I'd argue that one doesn't require software engineering skills to become a good competitive programmer. The coding knowledge required is really limited and due to time constraints it is better to write a quick spaghetti code.

## Reasons to Pursue
Although competitive programming is not a profession for many but a hobby. Here are some reasons why you should pursue it:

### ICPC & IOI
The [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/) and [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](https://ioinformatics.org/) are annual algorithmic programming contests for college and high school students respectively. They are considered the most prestegious programming contest and holds a great value for competitive programmers.

### Job Recruitment
The tech interview questions seem easier as a competitive programmer, since competitive programmers are really proficient in DSA. This maybe another controversial aspect, because the job skills may not correlate with DSA. However, this proves that competitive programming builds problem-solving skills that interviewers look for.

### Adrelanine rush
As a mind sport, it is the adrenaline rush and the intensity of the competition that programmers enjoy.
