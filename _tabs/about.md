This blog primarily serves the purpose for me to organise my thoughts, rationalise and reflect upon them as I document my progress of reaching the mentioned goals. Moreover I would also be writing tech-related material sharing what I learned throughout this journey. Whatever is written or said here is my personal opinion for myself to look back, reflect and learn, and by no means should be taken as an advice.


## Goals

### Long Term:
 - [Follow ML Roadmap](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/)
 - Graduate by 2025

### Short Term:
 - Daily blogging for a month
 - Linear Algebra course in a month
 - Calisthenics for a month


## About Me
I've always loved building new things. However, in my past I enjoyed more to break things apart. I spent my time modifying and exploiting video games to write cheat scripts for it. I enjoyed reverse engineering online games and hunt for bugs. Cheating was never more fun! But now, I feel the need to switch paths and pursue a passion that is more constructive, less destructive. That is why I have decided to spend next year extensively studying AI and become a Machine Learning Engineer to solve problems that are really meaningful.
